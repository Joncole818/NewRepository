This is test repository created on github. I cloned down the PC and created this readme file. 
I'm now going to upload this new file and changes. 


Added alt tags for images

changed sonme other things. 

I've made multiple repositories, helped others with theirs, yet tried to go the extra mile and ended up with what is this that's left.  I was given pre-work links just before first day. I have not been able to devote over 20 hours to catch up as expected these last two weeks, I just assigned a tutor and met with him yesterday, literally. I was told the prework doesn't matter at this point, but when I went back to start it back over, it made a HUGE difference. I'm tremendously behind so I did the best I could.
